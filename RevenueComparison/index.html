<h1> Introduction</h1>

    Although Bandcamp was initially established as another platform for artists and record labels to digitally release music, it has become something much more.
    <br><br>
    During the COVID-19 Pandemic, the platform provided a lifeline for many “vendors”, a term I’ll use to encompass independent artists and non-major label record labels. The steps taken by Bandcamp to directly support artists, such as waiving fees, hosting fee-waive days, and establishing the COVID-19 Artist Fund, demonstrated a commitment to the well-being of musicians and creators during a difficult time, leading to a positive reputation for the platform.
    <br><br>
    These actions resonated with artists and fans alike, as they not only provided artists with a means to generate income but also allowed fans to directly support their favorite musicians.
    <br><br>
    Moreover, Bandcamp has expanded its scope beyond music sales and has become a platform where many vendors now offer merchandise alongside their music. This presents a significant opportunity for Bandcamp to capitalize on.
    <br><br>
    In this project, I aim to explore this opportunity, which has the potential to create a new revenue stream, foster the creation of additional merchandise, and reduce the financial risk for vendors. Furthermore, embracing this opportunity can save vendors countless hours of administrative work, allowing them to focus more on their creative endeavors.

    <h3><strong>What Data is Used in this Analysis?</strong></h3>

<p>One Million Transactions on the platform from September 9th, 2020 to October 2nd, 2020.</p>

<h3>How Has This Data Been Processed?</h3>

    <p>To generate more detailed categories of data from the dataset, Python was utilized. For instance, a transaction that involved a tote bag was previously coded as simply 'p', which denoted a physical item, without any additional categorization to specify that the item belonged to the 'Tote Bags' sub-category under the broader 'Accessories' category. However, by analyzing the 'item_description' feature, more granular information about each transaction was generated. In addition, additional features were created such as 'Buyer/Seller Country Match' to enable further analysis in the future.</p>

<h2>Bandcamp has evolved into a comprehensive marketplace for not only music, but also merchandise.</h2>

<div id="vizContainer_CategoriesComparison" style="width:1000px; height:800px;"></div>

Despite the fact that only 4.96% of vendors (artists/labels) on the platform sell merchandise, this revenue stream has proven to be incredibly lucrative. In fact, in just the 24 days studied, <b>merchandise sales accounted for approximately 11% of Bandcamp's revenue</b>, amounting to over a million dollars.

<h2>While There Are Many Different Merchandise categories, T-Shirts are the most popular.</h2>
There were approximately 16,127 shirts sold, generating $383,788.68 in revenue.

    <div id="vizContainer_Merch_Cat_Bar_Chart" style="width:1000px; height:400px;"></div>

This figure does not account for bundle deals, where musical releases are solid with physical merchandise. For instance, a t-shirt may be sold with a vinyl record. 315 bundle deals included a t-shirt, generating $34,391.92 in revenue.

**Although there are at least 1943 vendors (artists/labels) who sold t-shirts on the platform, individual vendor's total revenue varies greatly.**

Among those who sold t-shirts, two generated more revenue than anyone else: the French Techno Label **SAIKE** + the Australian Rock Band **King Gizzard & The Lizard Wizard**. After these two outliers were removed, there is an other group of artists that called High Revenue Artists/Labels which produced some interesting insights.
