    <h3><strong>What Data is Used in this Analysis?</strong></h3>

<p>One Million Transactions on the platform from September 9th, 2020 to October 2nd, 2020.</p>

<h3>How Has This Data Been Processed?</h3>

    <p>To generate more detailed categories of data from the dataset, Python was utilized. For instance, a transaction that involved a tote bag was previously coded as simply 'p', which denoted a physical item, without any additional categorization to specify that the item belonged to the 'Tote Bags' sub-category under the broader 'Accessories' category. However, by analyzing the 'item_description' feature, more granular information about each transaction was generated. In addition, additional features were created such as 'Buyer/Seller Country Match' to enable further analysis in the future.</p>

<h2>Bandcamp has evolved into a comprehensive marketplace for not only music, but also merchandise.</h2>

<div id="vizContainer_CategoriesComparison" style="width:1000px; height:700px;"></div>

Despite the fact that only 4.96% of vendors (artists/labels) on the platform sell merchandise, this revenue stream has proven to be incredibly lucrative. In fact, in just the 24 days studied, <b>merchandise sales accounted for approximately 11% of Bandcamp's revenue</b>, amounting to over a million dollars.

<h2>While There Are Many Different Merchandise categories, T-Shirts are the most popular.</h2>
There were approximately 16,127 shirts sold, generating $383,788.68 in revenue.

    <div id="vizContainer_Merch_Cat_Bar_Chart" style="width:1000px; height:400px;"></div>

This figure does not account for bundle deals, where musical releases are solid with physical merchandise. For instance, a t-shirt may be sold with a vinyl record. 315 bundle deals included a t-shirt, generating $34,391.92 in revenue.

**Although there are at least 1943 vendors (artists/labels) who sold t-shirts on the platform, individual vendor's total revenue varies greatly.**

Among those who sold t-shirts, two generated more revenue than anyone else: the French Techno Label **SAIKE** + the Australian Rock Band **King Gizzard & The Lizard Wizard**. After these two outliers were removed, there is an other group of artists that called High Revenue Artists/Labels which produced some interesting insights.
